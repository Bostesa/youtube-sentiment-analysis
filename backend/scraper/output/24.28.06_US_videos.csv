DVxaFWBWDZY,"UgxV1TTrGAKCIYgthwt4AaABAg","My first time leaving a comment, but I have watched your sims videos and downloaded many of your builds. Thanks for those. My own feelings for this pack are also full of excitement. I purposely don&#39;t watch the game play videos for the same reason that you don&#39;t read the leaks on new releases. I don&#39;t want any spoilers. Part of the fun of playing is discovering what is new, for me, anyway. I really hope that the dynamics work well and they have more rejection interactions and actual animations not just moodlets. I&#39;m hoping, but not holding my breath, for more romantic autonomy between NPCs. I hate having to play every household just so my neighborhoods have some life progress. More break-ups. Sims get mad or lose relationship but never break-up. I like the drama. I hope this expansion surprises me.","@vfregvonbuttercup","2024-06-28T21:05:09Z","the sims is getting a ROMANCE PACK!!!

1bZ0OSEViyo,"UgxKqPUNSS-NizQnFPZ4AaABAg","The fact is that music doesn&#39;t matter as much to the younger generations.  They don&#39;t look to deeply into it like past generations did.  Music is more of a social accessory.  The younger generations are always going to seek the shortcut or the exploit to accomplish things.  Like DAWs.  Now nobody has to know how to play an instrument.  All they have to do is check a box in a piece of software after loading an &quot;instrument&quot;.  On one hand I can&#39;t blame them as it appears all of the best songs have been written and nobody can find any more.  The 90&#39;s brought humanity peak originality in music without sacrificing any of the quality.  Then it just kind of went down hill from there going into 2k with &quot;The thong song&quot; and a few failed revivals of boy bands.  Then came the mumble rappers and Lap-Pop stars and that is all we get today.  AI music will definitely end up cornering the market someday if not outright becoming the market in every manner except live performance.","@Kudeghraw","2024-06-28T22:03:50Z","The Real Reason Why Music Is Getting Worse","2024-06-25T19:42:13Z","UCJquYOG5EL82sKTfH9aMA9Q","Rick Beato","10",24.28.06,"rick beato|everything music|rick|beato|music|music theory|music production|education|A.I.|Artificial Intelligence|Taylor Swift|Beyonce|Universal Music Group|Billie Eilish|Spotify|Led Zeppelin|Apple Music|Streaming|Music Streaming|The End Of Creativity",1521234,112998,0,19469,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1bZ0OSEViyo/hqdefault.jpg,False,False,"In this episode, I discuss the crisis in music in two acts: Act I - Music is too Easy to MakeAct II - Music is too Easy to Consume...and their cumulative negative effect.  üìö The Channel Anniversary Bundle ‚Äî $89 FOR ALL OF My Courses: ‚á¢ https://rickbeato.com/üìò‚Äî The Beato Book Interactive - $99.00 valueüé∏ ‚Äî Beato Beginner Guitar - $159.00 valueüëÇ‚Äî The Beato Ear Training Program - $99.00 valueüé∏‚Äî The Quick Lessons Pro Guitar Course - $79.00 value‚Ä¶all for just $89.00Get it here: https://rickbeato.com/This sale will end Friday, June 30th at midnight ESTMy Beato Club supporters:Justin ScottTerence MarkJason MurrayLucienne KilpatrickAlexander YoungJason WagnerTodd LadnerRob KlineNicholas LongTim BensonLeonardo Martins da Costa RodriguesEddie PerezDavid SolomonMICHAEL JOYCEStephen Stubbscolin steadJonathan Wentworth-LintonPatrick PayneMATTHEW KARISMatthew BarouchShaun SamuelsDanny KurywchakGregory ReedySean ColemanAlexander VerbitskiyCL TurnerJason PappafotisJohn FulfordMargaret CarnoRobert CDavid M CombsEric FlattReto SpoerliHerr Moritz AdamMonte St. JohnsJon BeezleyPeter DeVaultEric NabstedtEric BeggsRich GermanoBrian BloomPeter PillitteriPiush Dahal"
